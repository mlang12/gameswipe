## About
GameSwipe is a Video Game Discovery Application built in the MERN stack. It utilized the [IGDB (internet game database)](https://api.igdb.com/) for most of the content you see on the site. 

Users are greated with a wall of random videogames that they can click on and explore when they visit the site. But the real value comes in when the a user signs up. Users create a profile by selecting their preferences for games they would like to see. Then the application will show them games one at a time based on their selected preferences. Users can choose to like or not like a game. All games a user likes will be saved to their profile for later viewing. 

Also feel free to search for games and explore from there...

### Future Enhancements
1. Improve mobile experience - at the moment some of the site is skewed in mobile.
2. Fix the "Swipe" ability so that swiping a game will actually do something.
3. Add ability for a signed-in user to 'like' a game from the 'game-view' right now a game can only be liked from swipe mode
4. Add filters for more granular search
